SWDV-600 - MS in Software Development
This course introduces fundamental computer programming concepts including data types, variables, functional abstraction, control structures, and common data structures. Students will practice using these concepts by writing Python to implement algorithms that operate on data retrieved from different sources (e.g., user input, files, etc.).
